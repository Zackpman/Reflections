How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

- Much less text to go through
- Specified line numbers and showed examples making it easy to spot and fix quickly
- Comparison to old code could be useful if you know the old code works

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

- You could see the changes that have been made to the current version
- If something doesn't work you can revert back to the old versions
- If something doesn't work, you can check to see which changes were made and potentially find errors
